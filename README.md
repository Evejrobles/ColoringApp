# ColoringApp
 My motivation for this coloring app was to give users an outlet to be creative and releive stress. The app would be useful or fun to anyone who enjoys drawing, and could be used whenever they want to draw. The app also has a coloring section with backgrounds that can be selected by the user.  Additional uses in [User Story.](userstory.pdf)
 
 Coloring App is complete as far as functionallity. The user is able to draw or color, then save and share the image. 
 No known bugs in the app. However, the app is fixed in portrait orientation because I was not able to save the image when phone was rotated to landscape.
